## ðŸ™‹ Hi, I'm Alex.

ðŸ“‘ I am a programmer with a background in computational linguistics. I graduated from Brown University in 2024 with a B.S. in Mathematics - Computer Science and a B.A. in Linguistics. Recently, I've been researching the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the creation of novel tasks and datasets.

ðŸ”­ I am currently looking for a full-time position where I can grow my natural language processing and machine learning skills as well as develop LLMs or AI-based tools.
